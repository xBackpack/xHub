# xHub

## Description

This is a lightweight script for Roblox Pressure! I only made this since I couldn't find one which wasn't hidden behind some scammy website. This script has features such as fullbright, anti entities, godmode, walkspeed buffs, FOV changes, and much, much more! There is no strict update schedule; I just add features when I have time.

Note that this is completely for fun and I am not doing this for money in any way.
If you want to support my development, I have a buy me a coffee page for donations in my profile.

## Installation (Only 3 steps)

1. Open your script executor
2. Copy and paste the following: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xBackpack/xHub/main/main.lua"))()
3. Execute

Done!

## Features
